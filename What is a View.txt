What is a View?

A view is a virtual table created from a SELECT query.
It looks like a table, but does not store data .Data is always fetched from the base tables.

Why Do We Use Views?
To Simplify Complex Queries,
To Improve Security (Hide Sensitive Columns)

How to Create a View:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;

Types of Views: Updatable and Non-Updatable Views

A view is updatable when:

Based on only one table
Contains no DISTINCT
Contains no GROUP BY, HAVING
Contains no aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
Contains no set operators (UNION, INTERSECT)
Columns in view must map directly to base table columns
Primary key column must be included

If these rules fail → view becomes non-updatable (read-only).

DDL work on all views: but only certain DDL operations apply to views
1️⃣ CREATE VIEW

CREATE VIEW v1 AS
SELECT customerid, contactname
FROM customers;

2️⃣ ALTER VIEW
You cannot rename a column in a view directly, add a new column, change datatype, drop a column.
but you can rename the column and add column by rewriting the complete SELECT query

adding new column:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1 AS
SELECT customerid, contactname, city
FROM customers;

renaming the column by using AS:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1 AS
SELECT customerid AS cid, contactname AS cname
FROM customers;

3️⃣ DROP VIEW
we can drop the view not the column

DROP VIEW v1;

4️⃣ RENAME VIEW
to rename view not the column, we will use:

RENAME TABLE old_view TO new_view;

DML works only on updatable Views:

insert
update
delete

DQL work on all views:

SELECT * FROM view_name;

TCL work on all views: But only affects changes made through DML

If you update a view and it updates the base table → TCL works
If the view is not updatable → no DML → TCL has nothing to commit/rollback

DCL work on all views:
You can grant or revoke permissions on ANY view.

Commands:

GRANT, REVOKE

GRANT SELECT ON view_name TO user1;
