MANUAL TESTING- SADHU

Phase1: Software testing concepts.
Phase2: Software testing project.
Phase3: Agile tool -Jira.

What is software?
Software is a set of programs used to do a specific task on a computer.
Software is a set of programs, instructions, and data that tells a computer what to do and how to do it.

Who develops?
Software is developed by software developers based on customer requirements.

Project:
Software developed for a specific customer /client based on their requirements is called a project.
Product:
Software developed based on market requirements is called a product.

Service  based companies:
Companies that develop projects are called service-based companies.
Ex: TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Accenture, Cognizant.

Product based companies:
Companies that develop products are called product-based companies.
Ex: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Netflix.

Types of Software: 
1. Free Software
Software that can be used without paying money.
Examples:
Google Chrome
WhatsApp
Gmail
Google Maps
Skype
Zoom (free version)

2. Open Source Software
Software whose source code is freely available and can be modified by anyone.
Examples:
Android
VLC Media Player
Linux
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Apache
Firefox

3. Licensed (Paid) Software
Software that must be purchased and used with a legal license.
Examples:
Microsoft Windows
MS Word / MS Office / MS Excel
Oracle Database
Adobe Photoshop




HOW SOFTWARE IS DEVELOPED ?
Software is developed by a process called SDLC.

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
1. Requirement Analysis
Customer explains their needs and expectations
Business analysts and managers collect requirements
Requirements are documented (SRS)
📌 Example: What features the software should have

2. Planning
Project plan is prepared
Time, cost, resources, and tools are decided
Risks are identified
📌 Example: How long the project will take and how many people are needed

3. Design
System architecture is designed
UI design and database design are prepared
📌 Example: Screens, flow, and structure of the application

4. Development (Coding)
Developers write code using programming languages
Each module is developed separately
📌 Example: Login, registration, payment modules

5. Testing
Testers check the software for defects
Ensure software works as per requirements
📌 Example: Checking login with valid and invalid inputs

6. Deployment
Software is released to the customer or market
Installed in production environment
📌 Example: Application goes live

7. Maintenance
Bugs are fixed
New features are added if needed
📌 Example: Updates and enhancements


WHY SOFTWARE IS TESTED ?
Software is tested to find whether the software is working as per customer/client requirements without defects.

HOW SOFTWARE IS TESTED ?
Software is tested by a process called STLC.

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
1. Requirement Analysis
Tester understands requirements
Identifies testable features
Prepares test scenarios
📌 Example: Understanding login requirements

2. Test Planning
Test strategy is prepared
Test effort, time, and resources are estimated
Tools and environments are decided
📌 Example: Deciding what and how to test

3. Test Case Design/ Development
Test cases and test data are written
Positive and negative scenarios are covered
📌 Example: Writing login test cases

4. Test Environment Setup
Hardware and software setup is done
Test environment is prepared
📌 Example: Setting up test server and database

5. Test Execution
Test cases are executed
Actual results are compared with expected results
Defects are logged in defect tracking tool (JIRA)
📌 Example: Executing login test cases

6. Defect Reporting and Tracking
Bugs are reported
Bugs are tracked until closure
📌 Example: Logging a defect in JIRA

7. Test Closure
Test summary report is prepared
Test results are documented
Lessons learned are noted
📌 Example: Final testing sign-off


So.. In the software development process, both programmers/developers and testers/QA are involved.

Levels of Software Testing

WHITE BOX TESTING(knowing the internal code/logic/source code)
1. Unit Testing
Testing of individual units(function, method, class) or modules of code.
Done by developers
Example:
Login Module: validate Username --> validate Password --> authenticate User.
Payment Module: select Payment Method --> process Payment --> generate Receipt.

2. Integration Testing
Testing whether two or more integrated modules work together correctly.
Done by developers
Example:
Login module + Database
Payment module + Bank gateway

BLACK BOX TESTING(without knowing the internal code/logic/source code)
3. System Testing
Testing the complete and integrated software. 
Done by testers (QA)
Example:
tests end-to-end functionality
Login → Add product → Make payment → Logout

4. User Acceptance Testing
Testing whether the software meets customer requirements.
Done by Customer / Client / End users

Example:
Client verifies whether software meets expectations


Types of SDLC models:
Waterfall, V-Model, Agile, Fish Model, Spiral, Incremental, Iterative, RAD, Prototype, Big Bang, DevOps.

V-MODEL (Verification & Validation Model)
Development and Testing happen in parallel
For each development phase, there is a corresponding testing phase
It is used in Small to Medium size projects.
Best when requirements are stable and fixed

Business(BRS)/User Requirements(URS)/(CRS)   ↔   User Acceptance Testing
System Requirements (SRS)                    ↔   System Testing
High Level Design (HLD)                      ↔   Integration Testing
Low Level Design (LLD)                       ↔   Unit Testing
                                          Coding

Verification/Static testing
Verification or static testing is the process of reviewing software documents and designs without executing the code to ensure correctness and completeness.

Verification is performed using static testing techniques:
Reviews: Checking the correctness and completeness of documents to identify defects and provide feedback.

Walkthroughs: An informal/semi formal meeting conducted by author, explains document for better understanding and to get feedback.

Inspections: Inspection is a formal and structured review conducted by a trained moderator to identify defects using defined roles and checklists.
Roles in Inspection:
Moderator --> Plans and conducts the inspection meeting.
Author --> who answers for doubts/questions
Reader --> who reads document
Inspector --> who identifies defects.
Recorder --> who logs identified defects.

Validation/Dynamic testing
Validation or dynamic testing is the process of testing the software to ensure it meets customer requirements and behaves as expected.

Validation is performed using Dynamic Testing
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
System Testing
User Acceptance Testing




QA (Quality Assurance) --> QA Manager, QA Lead
QA is process-oriented. It defines the processes or strategies to be followed in each phase to prevent defects.
QA involves in whole SDLC process

QC (Quality Control) ---> Manual Tester, Test Engineer.
QC is product-oriented. It follows the defined process and tests the actual software to detect defects.
QC involves in testing the software.

QE (Quality Engineer) Automation Tester


System Testing
It is the process of testing the complete and integrated software to verify that it meets all customer and business requirements.

There are two types of system testing
Functional Testing
Non Functional Testing

Functional Testing
It checks whether the software’s features and functions work according to business requirements.

Types of functional testing
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
System Testing
Smoke Testing:
   Testing whether the critical/major features of a new build are functioning correctly to determine if the build is stable for further testing.

Example: E-commerce Website
   Application Launch: Does Homepage loads successfully?
   Login:       Can user login with valid credentials?
   Search:      Can user search for products?
   Add to Cart: Can user add a product to the cart?
   Checkout:    Can user reach the payment page?

5. Sanity Testing:
   To check whether the specific functionality works properly after minor changes or bug fixes in the build.
   It is performed on stable builds.

Example: E-commerce Application --> Cart feature
   Issue: Product quantity update was not reflecting in the cart.
   Bug Fix: Quantity update functionality has been fixed.

   Sanity Testing Steps:
   Add a product to the cart
   Update the product quantity
   Verify that the total price updates correctly according to the changed quantity

6. Regression Testing:
   Checking whether the existing functionalities/features are working correctly after making changes(adding new feature, bug fixes) in the software.

Example: E-Commerce Application
   Existing functionalities:
   User registration
   Product search
   Add to cart
   checkout
   If a new discount feature is added, all the above must still work.

7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
8. Interface Testing:
   Checks whether the data communication between two modules or systems is working correctly.

From PAVAN SIR Videos:
Object Properties Testing
Checks whether the individual UI elements have the correct properties and functional behavior as per requirements.

Buttons & Controls
Button enabled/disabled
Button clickable
Text box editable or read-only
Drop-down shows correct values
Disabled field cannot be edited

Error Messages
Error appears when invalid input is entered
Correct validation message displayed
Message disappears after correction

Field Validations
Accepts only valid format (email, numbers)
Shows validation message for incorrect input
Field blocks invalid characters

Links Execution Testing
Whether the link is clickable
Whether it redirects to the correct page
Whether it loads without error (no 404, no crash)

Types of links
Internal Links: Links that navigate within the same website/application.
Clicking link “Profile” on Dashboard → Opens Profile page
Clicking company logo → Redirects to Home page

External Links: Links that navigate to another website/domain.
Example:
Clicking link “Follow us on Facebook” → Opens facebook.com
Clicking link “Pay Now” → Redirects to Razorpay/PayPal website

Broken Links: Links that do not work and show errors (like 404).
Example:
Clicking link “Offers” → Shows 404 Page Not Found
Clicking link “Terms & Conditions” → Blank page opens

Visibility & State
Element is visible or hidden as required
Default values are displayed correctly
Checkbox / radio button selection works correctly

2. Database testing
Checks whether the data entered through the application's UI is correctly stored, updated, retrieved, and deleted in the database.
INSERT: After user registration --> user details are stored correctly in the Users table.
UPDATE: After updating profile information --> the updated details are reflected in the Users table.
DELETE: After deleting a user account --> the user record is removed from the Users table.
SELECT: After logging in --> user details are retrieved from the Users table.
Here Manual tester executes SQL queries to verify that the data is correctly inserted, updated, deleted, or retrieved from the database.

3. Error handling Testing

4. Calculation Testing
Checks whether mathematical calculations in the application are working correctly as per business requirements.
Example: E-Commerce Application
🖥 Scenario:
User adds products to cart.
Product A = ₹500
Product B = ₹300
Discount = 10%
GST = 5%

🔎 Tester Verifies:
Subtotal = 800
Discount = 80
Tax calculated correctly
Final total amount is correct

5. Links Existence & Execution Testing

6. Cookies & Sessions Testing
Cookies Testing: Checks whether the cookies(small text files) are properly created, stored, updated, and deleted in the browser as per requirements

Example 1: “Remember Me” Login
User selects Remember Me and logs in
Close browser → Open again → User remains logged in

Tester verifies:
Cookie is created after login
Expiry date is set properly
Cookie is deleted after logout
No sensitive data(like password) stored

Types of Cookies
Session Cookie
No fixed expiry date
Automatically deleted when browser is closed
Example: Login without “Remember Me”

Persistent Cookie
Has a fixed expiry date (hours/days/months)
Remains even after browser is closed
Example: Login with “Remember Me”

Sessions Testing: Checks whether the user sessions are properly created, maintained, expired, and destroyed on the server.

Example 1: Banking Application
User logs in
Navigates between pages

Tester verifies:
Session is created after login.
Session remains active while navigating.
User is automatically logged out after inactivity (5–10 minutes).
Session ends after logout.
After logout, protected pages cannot be opened.


Non Functional Testing
It checks how well the system performs, rather than what it does.

Types of non functional testing
Performance Testing
   Checks speed, response time, and stability of system under various workloads.

   a). Load Testing
   Checks system behavior under expected load/number of users.

   b). Stress Testing
   Checks system behavior beyond normal capacity to determine breaking point.

   c). Spike Testing: Checks system behavior when there is a sudden increase or decrease in users.
       Example: Big Billion Sale – sudden traffic spike.

   d). Volume Testing: Checks system performance with large amount of data.
       Example: Testing database performance with 10 million records.


   e). Endurance Testing (Soak Testing): Checks system performance under continuous load for a long period.
       Example: Running system with 5,000 users for 24 hours.

2. Scalability Testing
   checks whether the system can handle increasing users, load, or data without performance issues.
  Types of Scalability
   Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up): Increasing the capacity(RAM, CPU, Storage) of an existing server.
   Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out): Increasing the number of application servers to distribute load.

3. Reliability Testing
   checks whether the system works continuously without failure for a specific period of time.

4. Security Testing
   Checks whether application is protected from unauthorized access and attacks.
   Example: 
   SQL Injection Testing.
   password encryption.
   Authentication --> Verifies valid user identity 
   Authorization --> Decides user permissions

5. Recovery Testing
   Checks how quickly system recovers after failure or crash.
   Example: Power failure → System restores data correctly.

6. Compatibility Testing
   Checks whether application works properly on different browsers, devices, and operating systems.
   Example:
   Cross-Browser → Works in all browsers(Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
   Cross-Platform → Works on different os's (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
   Device Compatibility → Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   Screen Resolution → UI looks correct on different screen sizes.
   Hardware Compatibility → Works on different system configurations(RAM, CPU, storage).
   Forward Compatibility → Works with newer versions of OS.
   Backward Compatibility → Works with older versions of OS.

7. Installation Testing
   Checks whether the application installs, updates, and uninstalls properly without errors.




GUI(Graphical User Interface) Testing:
It is the process of verifying visual and interactive elements of a software application's user interface, to ensure it meets design specifications and provides a seamless user experience.


GUI includes all visible components such as:

Buttons
Text boxes / text areas
Drop-downs
Checkboxes
Radio buttons
Links & hyperlinks
Icons & images
Menus
Dialog boxes / pop-ups
Labels, headings
Scroll bars
Fonts, colors, alignment

What is Verified in GUI Testing?

Consistent layout across pages
Correct alignment (left, right, center)
Example: Login button aligned below password field.

2. Colors, Fonts & Style
Correct font size and style
Proper color contrast
Readable text
Example: Error message shown in red.

3. Field Validations
Mandatory field marked with *
Error message aligned properly

4. Buttons & Controls

Button position on screen

5. Link Existence Testing
Whether the link is present
Proper placement
Link text is correct


6. Error Messages
Error message color (red)
Proper placement near field
Readable font size
Error message should be clear and understandable to the user

7. Keyboard & Mouse Actions
Correct tab order
Mouse hover effects work
Keyboard navigation works

8. Images & Icons
Images load correctly
No broken images
Proper size and alignment

9. Screen Resolution & Zoom
UI does not break on different screen sizes
UI remains usable on zoom in / zoom out

10. Cross-Browser GUI Behavior
UI looks consistent across browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
No layout distortion

Usability Testing:
It's a non-functional testing technique used to verify how easy and user-friendly a software application is when real users interact with it.

If a user gets stuck at any point, there should be a help option that provides simple and clear steps to resolve the issue.



SDLC -- testing (STLC)
STLC

Test design techniques comes in the 3rd phase of STLC 
Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning 
3. Test Case Design/ Development
--> Create test scenarios
--> Apply test design techniques (BVA, EP, Decision Table, etc.)
--> Write detailed test cases
--> Prepare test data
--> Review test cases
4. Test Environment Setup
5. Test Execution
6. Defect Reporting and Tracking
7. Test Closure

Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
It's a test design technique that tests the edge values (boundaries) of an input range, because defects usually occur at the boundaries.

Where It Is Useful
Numeric fields Age--(18–60), Salary(50000-100000), Quantity(1-100).
Date ranges--(01-01-2026 to 31-01-2026)
Username length(8-10 characters), Password length (8–16 characters)
Any field with minimum and maximum limits--(File size must be between 1MB–5MB.)

Example: Requirement: Password length must be 8–16 characters.
For any input range, we check 6 values:

Here, the input range is 8-16

Test data/Test values:
7 → Invalid (min-1)
8 → Valid (min)
9 → Valid (min+1)
15 → Valid (max-1)
16 → Valid (max)
17 → Invalid (max+1)

2. Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)
It's a test design technique that divides input data into valid and invalid groups (partitions) where the system behaves the same for all values in that group.

Where It Is Useful
Numeric fields Age--(18–60), Salary(50000-100000), Quantity(1-100).
Date ranges--(01-01-2026 to 31-01-2026)
Username(8-10 characters), Password length (8–16 characters)
Any field with minimum and maximum limits--(File size must be between 1MB–5MB)

Example: Requirement: Password length must be 8–16 characters.

Identify Partitions and test one value from each partition, because all values in that partition behave similarly.
Password length < 8 → Invalid partition
Password length 8–16 → Valid partition
Password length > 16 → Invalid partition

Test data/Test values:
6 → Invalid
10 → Valid
20 → Invalid   

Example: Requirement: Username must contain only small letters (a–z), Length must be 5–10 characters.

Identify Partitions and test one value from each partition, because all values in that partition behave similarly.
Length < 5 --> abc, abcd --> Invalid Partition
Length 5-10 --> abcde, testing --> Valid Partition
Length > 10 --> abcdefghijk, longusername --> Invalid Partition
Length 5-10 --> Abcde, Userone --> Invalid Partition (Contains Capital Letters)
Length 5-10 --> user1, abc12 --> Invalid Partition(Contains Numbers)
Length 5-10 --> user@, name_1 --> Invalid Partition(Contains Special Characters)

You can replace above 3 lines with this one line
Length 5–10 & contains non a–z characters → Invalid

Test data/Test values:
abc → Invalid (less than 5)
abcde → Valid
abcdefghijk → Invalid (more than 10)
Abcde → Invalid (capital letter)
user1 → Invalid (number)
user@ → Invalid (special character)
 
3. Decision Table Testing
It is a test design technique used when system behavior/output depends on multiple conditions.
It lists all possible combinations of conditions and their corresponding results/actions in a table format.

Where It Is Useful
Business rule validations
Online banking transactions
Discount calculations
Loan approval systems
Login validation systems
Any feature where multiple conditions decide one result


Example: Online Money Transfer
Requirement: Money transfer should be successful only if:
User is logged in
Account is active
Sufficient balance is available
OTP is verified
If any condition fails → Transfer should fail.

Step 1: Identify Conditions
C1: Logged in? (Yes / No)
C2: Account Active? (Yes / No)
C3: Sufficient Balance? (Yes / No)
C4: OTP Verified? (Yes / No)
Each condition has 2 possibilities.
Total combinations = 2⁴ = 16 combinations

Step 2: Create Decision Table
Rule	Login	Active	Balance	OTP	Result
1	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Transfer Success
2	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Fail (Not logged in)
3	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Fail (Inactive account)
4	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Fail (Insufficient balance)
5	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Fail (OTP failed)

(All other combinations where any condition = No → Transfer Failed)


Step 3: Create Test Cases
Each row becomes one test case.
Example:

TC1 → All Yes → Expect Success
TC2 → Login = No → Expect Failure
TC3 → Account Inactive → Expect Failure
TC4 → Balance Insufficient → Expect Failure
TC5 → OTP Incorrect → Expect Failure

Test data / Test combinations

Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes → Success
No, Yes, Yes, Yes → Fail
Yes, No, Yes, Yes → Fail
Yes, Yes, No, Yes → Fail
Yes, Yes, Yes, No → Fail
